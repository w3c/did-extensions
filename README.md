🌐 **DX-MANA Extended DID Ecosystem**  
This repository is a sovereign fork of the official [w3c/did-extensions](https://github.com/w3c/did-extensions), customized and curated for the DX-MANA decentralized identity realm.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This repository integrates, extends, and adapts the W3C DID ecosystem specifications to support:

- 🧬 Metadata-bound DIDs  
- 📡 ENS + IPFS native resolution  
- 🧩 Modular identity schemas  
- 🧠 Neural-bound identities used by DX-MANA CORE

---

## 📁 Structure

This repository includes:

- `methods/` — DX-MANA-specific method entries  
- `resolution/` — Extended DID resolution behaviors  
- `tooling/` — Validation tools for sovereign DID entries  
- `transitions/` — Compatibility layers for schema upgrades

---

## 🛡️ Sovereignty

- Fully decentralized and contract-controlled  
- Bound to `did:mana:*` method and its sub-identities  
- ENS-native: [`dx-manacore.eth`](https://dx-manacore.eth.link)

---

## 📡 Verifiable Data Registries

Supports DIDs anchored on:

- `IPFS`  
- `ENS`  
- `DNS`  
- `HTTPS`
