    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>
This document serves as an official registry for all known global parameters,
properties, and values used by the Decentralized Identifier ecosystem.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h1>The Registration Process</h1>
    <p>
Software implementers might find that the existing Decentralized Identifier Core
specification [[DID-CORE]] is not entirely capable of addressing their use case
and might need to add a new parameters, properties, or values to this registry
in order to achieve their use case in a globally interoperable fashion. In order
to add a new parameter, property, or value to this registry, an implementer MUST
submit a modification request for this registry, as a pull request on the
repository where this registry is hosted, where the modification request adheres
to the following policies:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
Any addition to the DID Core Registries MUST specify a human readable
description of the addition.
      </li>
      <li>
Any name or value of a property or parameter MUST be indicative of
its function. Avoid generic terms such as "myProperty" or "foo".
      </li>
      <li>
Any method name SHOULD avoid generic terms such as "mymethod" or "registry".
      </li>
      <li>
If there are copyright, trademark, or any intellectual property rights
concerns, the addition and use MUST be authorized in writing by the intellectual
property rights holder under a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_and_non-discriminatory_licensing">F/RAND</a>
license. Examples include DID Methods that use trademarked brand names,
property names that utilize the titles of copyrighted works, and patented
technology that would cause the use of the extension to require licensing a
patent.
      </li>
      <li>
Any addition MUST NOT create unreasonable legal, security, moral, or privacy
issues that will result in direct harm to others. Examples of unacceptable
additions include any containing racist language, technologies used to
persecute minority populations, and unconsented pervasive tracking.
      </li>
      <li>
Any addition to the DID Core Registries MUST link, via at least a URL,
preferably a content-integrity protected one, to the defining specification so
that implementers can implement the property.
      </li>
      <li>
Any addition to the DID Core Registries that is a property or value, MUST
specify a machine readable JSON-LD Context for the addition.
        <ul>
          <li>
The JSON-LD Context MUST be included in full as part of the submission.
          </li>
          <li>
A namespace URI MUST be provided for the JSON-LD Context so that consumer
implementations can consistently map a URI to the full context.
          </li>
          <li>
The URI provided MUST be persistent, and link all terms to their associated
human readable descriptions.
          </li>
          <li>
The URI provided SHOULD resolve or link to the full context contents.
          </li>
          <li>
JSON-LD Contexts MUST be versioned and MUST NOT be date stamped.
          </li>
          <li>
JSON-LD Contexts SHOULD use scoped terms and MUST use the <code>@protected</code>
feature to eliminate the possibility of term conflicts.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
Properties in the DID Core Registries MUST NOT be removed, only deprecated.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
The Editors of the DID Specification Registries MUST consider all of the
policies above when reviewing additions to the registry and MUST reject registry
entries if they violate any of the policies in this section. Entities
registering additions can challenge rejections first with the W3C DID Working
Group and then, if they are not satisfied with the outcome, with the W3C Staff.
W3C Staff need not be consulted on changes to the DID Specification Registries,
but do have the final authority on registry contents. This is to ensure that W3C
can adequately respond to time sensitive legal, privacy, security, moral, or
other pressing concerns without putting an undue operational burden on W3C
Staff.
    </p>

    <p>
Entries that are identified to cause interoperability problems MAY be marked as
such at the discretion of the maintainers of this registry, and if possible,
after consultation with the entry maintainer.
    </p>

    <p>
Any submission to the registries that meet all the criteria listed above will be
accepted for inclusion. These registries enumerate all known mechanisms that
meet a minimum bar, without choosing between them.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h1>The Labeling Process</h1>
    <p>
      This section describes labels that are used to categorize registry entries.
    </p>

<dl class="label-legend">
<dt>
<span class="label-deprecated">Deprecated</span>
</dt>
<dd>
This label is applied to registry entries that should not be relied on.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="label-no-contact-info">No Contact Info</span>
</dt>
<dd>
This label is applied to registry entries for which no point of contact has been provided.
</dd>
</dl>


  </section>


  <section>
    <h1>Property Names</h1>

    <p>
The following section defines the properties available for use in a DID
document. Note that some of these properties are defined in the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core">DID Core Specification</a>, and
others are defined elsewhere and may be method- or domain-specific. Please read
the associated specifications to ensure that the properties you use are
appropriate for your implementation. The properties are arranged here according
to the purpose they serve.
    </p>

    <p class="issue">
This registry is a work in progress and some properties are missing normative
definitions. We are working on this! This does NOT mean that in future it will
be possible to submit items to the registry without normative definitions (see <a href="#the-registration-process"></a>).
    </p>

    <section>
      <h3>DID document properties</h3>
      <p>
These properties are foundational to DID documents, and are expected to be
useful to all DID methods.

<a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-spec-registries/issues/370">DID
Specification Registries Issue 370</a> This property should be moved into a
separate suite and linked to here rather than relying on the Verifiable
Credentials vocabulary. There are known issues with the first version of the
Security vocabulary JSON-LD context and the first version of the Verifiable
Credentials JSON-LD context which will prevent these contexts from being listed
in the same document. For now it's suggested that implementers rely upon the
first version of the Verifiable Credentials JSON-LD context and not rely on
the Security vocabulary JSON-LD context in the same document.

    <h1>DID Methods</h1>

    <p>
This table summarizes the DID method specifications currently in development.
The links will be updated as subsequent Implementer’s Drafts are produced.
    </p>
    <p>
The normative requirements for DID method specifications can be found in
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#methods">Decentralized Identifiers
v1.0: Methods</a> [[DID-CORE]]. DID methods that do not meet these requirements
will not be accepted. We encourage DID method authors to provide an email
address in the Author Links column, as this helps with maintenance.
If an email address is omitted, a label noting that there is no
contact information for the author will be applied to the registry entry.
