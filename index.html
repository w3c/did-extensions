    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>
This document serves as a list of documents that contain known properties and
values used by DID Methods [[DID-CORE]] and DID Resolution [[DID-RESOLUTION]] in
the Decentralized Identifier ecosystem.
    </p>

  <section id="conformance"></section>

  </section>

  <section>
    <h1>The Registration Process</h1>
    <p>
Software implementers might find that the existing Decentralized Identifier Core
specification [[DID-CORE]] is not entirely capable of addressing their use case
and might need to add a new parameters, properties, or values to this repository
in order to achieve their use case in a globally interoperable fashion. In order
to add a new parameter, property, or value to this repository, an implementer MUST
submit a modification request for this repository, as a pull request on the
repository where this repository is hosted, where the modification request adheres
to the following policies:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
Any addition to the DID Extensions MUST specify a human readable
description of the addition.
      </li>
      <li>
Any name or value of a property or parameter MUST be indicative of
its function. Avoid generic terms such as "myProperty" or "foo".
      </li>
      <li>
Any method name SHOULD avoid generic terms such as "mymethod" or "registry".
      </li>
      <li>
Any DID Method submission MUST not impose any concerns about copyright,
trademark, or intellectual property rights on the W3C, DID Method
implementers, or users. To that end, the following apply:
        <ol>
          <li>
DID Method submitters affirm to the best of their knowledge that their 
submission will not infringe upon or otherwise violate the rights of any third 
party.
          </li>
          <li>
If there are any known concerns about copyright, trademark, or intellectual
property rights, the addition and use of a DID Method MUST be authorized in
writing by the holder of the intellectual property rights under an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_and_non-discriminatory_licensing">F/RAND</a> 
license.
          </li>
          <li>
If a DID Method is subsequently alleged to violate any copyright, trademark, 
or intellectual property rights, those making the allegation MUST provide 
documentation of their granted legal rights or an order from a court or 
arbitral tribunal, in each case of competent jurisdiction.
          </li>
          <li>
Should documentation of legally valid and enforceable copyright, trademark,
or intellectual property rights be presented, then, at the discretion of the 
rights holder, the DID Method in question MUST be removed.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
Any addition MUST NOT create unreasonable legal, security, moral, or privacy
issues that will result in direct harm to others. Examples of unacceptable
additions include any containing racist language, technologies used to
persecute minority populations, and unconsented pervasive tracking.
      </li>
      <li>
Any addition to the DID Extensions MUST link, via at least a URL,
preferably a content-integrity protected one, to the defining specification so
that implementers can implement the property.
      </li>
      <li>
Any addition to the DID Extensions that is a property or value, MUST
specify a machine readable JSON-LD Context for the addition.
        <ul>
          <li>
The JSON-LD Context MUST be included in full as part of the submission.
          </li>
          <li>
A namespace URI MUST be provided for the JSON-LD Context so that consumer
implementations can consistently map a URI to the full context.
          </li>
          <li>
The URI provided MUST be persistent, and link all terms to their associated
human readable descriptions.
          </li>
          <li>
The URI provided SHOULD resolve or link to the full context contents.
          </li>
          <li>
JSON-LD Contexts MUST be versioned and MUST NOT be date stamped.
          </li>
          <li>
JSON-LD Contexts SHOULD use scoped terms and MUST use the <code>@protected</code>
feature to eliminate the possibility of term conflicts.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
Properties in the DID Extensions MUST NOT be removed, only deprecated.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
The Editors of the DID Specification Registries MUST consider all of the
policies above when reviewing additions to the repository and MUST reject repository
entries if they violate any of the policies in this section. Entities
registering additions can challenge rejections first with the W3C DID Working
Group and then, if they are not satisfied with the outcome, with the W3C Staff.
W3C Staff need not be consulted on changes to the DID Specification Registries,
but do have the final authority on repository contents. This is to ensure that W3C
can adequately respond to time sensitive legal, privacy, security, moral, or
other pressing concerns without putting an undue operational burden on W3C
Staff.
    </p>

    <p>
Entries that are identified to cause interoperability problems MAY be marked as
such at the discretion of the maintainers of this repository, and if possible,
after consultation with the entry maintainer.
    </p>

    <p>
Any submission to the registries that meet all the criteria listed above will be
accepted for inclusion. These registries enumerate all known mechanisms that
meet a minimum bar, without choosing between them.
    </p>
